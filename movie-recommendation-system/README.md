# Movie Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a movie recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering, SQL data preparation, Power BI dashboards, and scalable ETL/deployment on Azure Databricks and AWS EC2.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Python scripts for data processing, modeling, ETL, and deployment
- **data/**: Sample datasets (movies, ratings, etc.)
- **images/**: Dashboard screenshots and visualizations
- **dashboards/**: Power BI dashboard files
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and prototyping

## Features
- Collaborative and content-based filtering models (Python)
- SQL queries for data preparation (joins, aggregations, CTEs, window functions)
- Power BI dashboards for KPIs and user segmentation
- Automated ETL pipelines in PySpark (Azure Databricks)
- Deployment scripts for Databricks and AWS EC2

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run scripts in `src/` for data processing and modeling
3. Use Power BI dashboard in `dashboards/`
4. See `notebooks/` for EDA and prototyping

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
